## Our Commitment to Accessibility

The Decentralized Democracy App is developed with a fundamental commitment to keeping democratic tools accessible to all citizens. We believe that the software that powers our governance systems should be transparent, accessible, and free from proprietary restrictions.

## Why This Matters

Democratic tools should be public resources, not proprietary products. By ensuring this software remains open and accessible, we protect it from becoming a tool that can be weaponized through restricted access or hidden functionality.

Our vision is to create a family of interoperable, community-owned democratic tools that put power back in the hands of citizens. Your contributions help make this vision a reality.
