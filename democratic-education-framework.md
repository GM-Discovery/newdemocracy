## Bloom's Taxonomy for Knowledge Quality
1. **Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts
2. **Understand** - Explain ideas or concepts, translate between forms
3. **Apply** - Use information in new situations, implement methods
4. **Analyze** - Draw connections among ideas, deconstruct complex systems
5. **Evaluate** - Justify a stance, critique based on criteria, assess quality
6. **Create** - Produce original work, synthesize elements into new patterns

## Great Teachers Throughout History

1. **Jesus Christ (c. 4 BCE-30 CE)** - Transformed teaching through parables, lived example, and radical love. His approach made complex spiritual truths accessible through stories connected to everyday life, demonstrated knowledge as inseparable from action, and established love as the foundation of learning. His teaching method invited listeners to discover meaning rather than imposing doctrine, and his pedagogical approach prioritized transformation of the whole person.

4. **Socrates (470-399 BCE)** - Pioneered questioning method that built critical thinking rather than transmitting information. His approach centered on drawing out knowledge from within students rather than imposing it from without, demonstrating education as fundamentally dialogical.

5. **Confucius (551-479 BCE)** - Created an educational philosophy integrating moral, social, political, and cultural dimensions. His approach balanced intellectual development with character formation and emphasized education's role in creating social harmony.

7. **Maria Montessori (1870-1952)** - Revolutionized education through scientific observation of children's natural learning processes. Her method respected children's autonomy, created prepared environments for self-directed learning, and recognized development follows predictable patterns requiring appropriate materials at each stage.

8. **John Dewey (1859-1952)** - Integrated education with democracy and experiential learning. His approach connected education to real community problems, positioned schools as miniature societies, and viewed education as continuous reconstruction of experience.

10. **bell hooks (1952-2021)** - Created engaged pedagogy integrating feminist and anti-racist perspectives. Her approach emphasized education as practice of freedom, honored students' lived experiences, and created transgressive learning spaces that challenged dominant paradigms.
